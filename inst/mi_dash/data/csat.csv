The new system requires the managers to have a lot more input which is provng difficult for us. The HR Team are set as the Recruitment administrator and super users. The Recruitment administrator and super users should be able to do all the functions a manager can do such as provide interview feedback.  Once a section has been completed the system does not allow you to go back and amend or make any changes. This is causing us a lot pf problems. An example is a candidate did not book into an interview via NHS jobs and phoned the manager and verbally arranged an interview time. The manager did not change anything in NHS jobs or book the candidate into a slot. This candidate was successful after the interview but the system would not allow us to notify the unsuccessful candidates or change the status of the successful candidated. As a whole it is too restrictive and does not provide the same amount as functions as the previous system.  It is also too reliant on the canidates logginf into the system after they have been offered the job to provide further information. To date no candidate has actually logged into the system to provide this information once being offered the job which is causing us greater work by having to chase outside of the system. With the old system the information such as address and references was already provided on the application form which speed the recruitment process up. The new system is actually hampering our recruitment and taking up valuable time and causing recruitment to take a lot longer.,Fairly difficult,It is far too restrictive in what it allows you to do and the information provided from the applicants.,Frequently asked questions (FAQs),User guides,,,,Useful,They are very useful and easy to use as step by step guidance.
